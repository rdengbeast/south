13.3: need cast from less to more specific.
13.5: yes: a, d
13.9: b, e, f, g, h
13.10: super used to access superclass method or constructor

13.11: both are because both call g, and yet point to different methods.
13.12: first ones late , getBalance is is early binding because it belongs to BankAccount
13.14: instance fields should be private. static fields could be public because that's part of their functionality
13.15: instance methods and static methods should be public
13.16: I think you could overwrite them, the same as you would for instance methods
13.17: public fields are dangerous because they can be changed by a client program unintentionally.

shallow vs deep: shallow is where instance field points to original copy
deep: brand new object with stuff copied.
