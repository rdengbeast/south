4.4 an integer overflow can be Integer.MAX_VALUE + 5, where the result would just be the lowest possible integer plus 5. 
a floating point roundoff is when a float/double have small values after what's shown on the screen. like 1.0 would actually be something like 1.000000000000001


4.5	the program uses doubles to add/subtract, so when you add them they amount to a little more than what you're expecting. a good solution is to 
	make a method that rounds the amount to a specified decimal place.
4.6, the first one you take away all decimal places, the second, you round the floating thing
4.7	again, the first one you take the sum, then take away all decimal places. second, you just round the number.
	3.0 would give same answers, 3.6 wouldn't
4.15 a final variable can't be changed. and no, you can't define a final without supplying a value.	 
4.11	true, false, false
4.12	getting first character of a string: string.substring(0, 1); Last character of a string: string.substring( string.length() - 1);
		removing: string anewstring = string.substring(1, string.length() ); stringanewstring = string.substring(0, string.length() );
